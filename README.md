# Sprint_Retrospectives
Retrospectives for agile teams

This app allows you to create Retrospective boards for your agile teams where your scrum master can create a retros board, share its link with all the team members 
and everyone gives their thoughts on what went well, what did not go well and what actions need be taken to avoid similar scenarios in the next sprint.

The app is build using socket.io(server implementation with NodeJS) and React(front-end)
